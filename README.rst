gnuper
======

**gnuper** is an open source python package for the preprocessing of mobile phone metadata whilst keeping privacy in mind. It is being developed by the spin-off project `knuper <https://www.knuper.com>`_ of the Freie Universit√§t Berlin.
The package creates features on antenna level off of mobile phone metadata like simple incoming to outgoing ratios of calls or sms as well as entropy and isolation indicators of antennas. Additionally one can include antenna averages of the bandicoot individual indicators developed by the MIT. Further information on this toolkit can be found `here <http://bandicoot.mit.edu/>`_.
